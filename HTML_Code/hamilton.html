        <p>Follow the meteoric rise of Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant orphan who became George Washington's right-hand man, the architect of the U.S. financial system, and a fiery revolutionary whose ideas and legacy shaped a nation. Amidst political intrigue, scandal, and rivalry, Hamilton's relentless ambition collides with the ideals of his peers, including his legendary adversary Aaron Burr, the Schuyler sisters, and Thomas Jefferson.</p>

        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <p>One of the most successful musicals of our time, a historic retelling of one of the founding fathers of the United States of America - but still not entirely without its issues as some friends have pointed out - I didn't know what to expect from a different cast, but it didn't matter. </p>

        <p>Okay, let's just get this out of the way. 'Hamilton' is stupendously good. Yes, it's kind of a drag that there's so much hype around it. But there was a lot of hype around penicillin.</p>

        <p>It's an experience I've had a few times in my life, always in the presence of great art. I remember staying up well past bedtime as a teenager reading Hamilton, then having to get out of bed and march around my room, because reality felt inadequate.</p>
