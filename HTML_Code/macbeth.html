        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <p>The creative decisions and strong performances by the cast resulted in a genuinely unsettling and thought-provoking work. The director, Adam Sherlock, clearly had a strong vision and was very successful in achieving it.</p>

        <p>I loved many of the features in the production. For example, the fights were exciting and well-choreographed. Various actors were involved in the fight scenes at a time, each one having a specific role in the fight - and there were captivating sword duels. Knowing how much work goes into creating a fight scene, I thought they were well-executed. </p>
