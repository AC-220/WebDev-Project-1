        <p>While The Cat and the Mouse attempts to reimagine the classic adversarial dynamic between predator and prey, the production struggles to strike a consistent tone, leaving the audience uncertain whether they're watching a children's fable or a deeper allegory about relationships and conflict. Despite some bright moments, the play falters under the weight of its ambition.</p>
