        <img src="merchant.jpg" alt="An image of Merchant of Venice poster"  width = "200" length = "100" >
        <p>Meet the noble but troubled merchant Antonio, who risks everything to help his dear friend Bassanio woo the enchanting Portia, a woman of wit and grace bound by an unusual test of love. Meanwhile, the infamous Shylock, a Jewish moneylender with a heart hardened by years of prejudice, strikes a perilous bargain that sets the stage for one of literature's most intense and thought-provoking confrontations.</p>

        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <p>The courtroom scene powerfully shows political conspiracy and a thuggish corruption of the law, Portia's “quality of mercy” speech rich with perverse irony. If this scene ever meant to pit Christian mercy against Old Testament Jewish vengefulness, it is exposed as a hollow sham.</p>

        <p>The Merchant of Venice tells a tale of loyalty, discourse and mercy. Playing at the Cats Eyes Theatre, William Shakespeare's incredible script is brought to life by an equally incredible cast. Sitting down to watch the show, there was a hush that settled over as the first scene played out. The audience had high expectations; and they were most certainly met. The mesmerising characterisation by the actors had the audience hooked, but the ending felt rather lacklustre.</p>

        <p>Many a production has wrestled with the thorny issues that lie, from a modern, more enlightened perspective, at the heart of Shakespeare's problematic play. Dylan Burke and director Mary Smith's skilfully reimagined, 1930s London-set adaptation successfully reframes the prejudice that runs through it.</p>
